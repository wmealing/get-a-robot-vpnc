This is a work in progress.  Mail me at my username (check the google project page)
at gmail.com with any corrections.

The long term goal is to get all of this in an installable package, not quite sure
how to do that yet, probably requires all kinds of java trickery.

Building from source
--------------------

Building this project from source is not too difficult if you have
the current tree buildin.

Check out the project from the google code and link the directories 
into the main subversion repository.

For example, in the external/ directory:

	libgcrypt -> /home/android/get-a-robot-vpnc/external/libgcrypt/
	libgpg-error -> /home/android/get-a-robot-vpnc/external/libgpg-error/
	vpnc -> /home/android/get-a-robot-vpnc/external/vpnc/
	vpnc-tools -> ../../get-a-robot-vpnc/external/vpnc-tools/

Then from the root of the svn checkout, start a build.

mydroid $ make
build/core/product_config.mk:261: WARNING: adding test OTA key
============================================
TARGET_PRODUCT=generic
TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT=eng
TARGET_SIMULATOR=
TARGET_BUILD_TYPE=release
TARGET_ARCH=arm
HOST_ARCH=x86

<bucket of lines scroll, and build finishes>

In the external/vpnc-tools/ dirctory there should be shell script
that must be run on the system that is building the tools ( not the phone)
This creates an tarball of the tools ready as the application would expect
it to exist on disk.  This creates the tarball that will be used in the
next section.


Installing from tarball
-----------------------

The extracted tarball represents the expected ondisk layout.  One can
upload the compressed image and extract ( At the time of writing i dont
know if there is a console unzip/tar/extractor on the pristine image).





Installing from the apk file
----------------------------
Not complete at this time
